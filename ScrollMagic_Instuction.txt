=> Scroll Magic is the perfect library for you, if you want to ...

    -->animate based on scroll position – either trigger an animation or synchronize it to the scrollbar 
       movement (like a playback scrub control).
    -->pin an element starting at a specific scroll position – either indefinitely or for a limited amount 
       of scroll progress (sticky elements).
    -->toggle CSS classes of elements on and off based on scroll position.
    -->effortlessly add parallax effects to your website.
    -->create an infinitely scrolling page (ajax load of additional content).
    -->add callbacks at specific scroll positions or while scrolling past a specific section, passing a 
       progress parameter.

=> To implement animations, ScrollMagic can work with multiple frameworks:-

    -->The recommended solution is the /*Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP)*/ due to its stability and 
       feature richness. For a more lightweight approach the /*VelocityJS*/ framework is also supported.       

                /*---- step by step guide ---*/

1). Add ScrollMagic.min.js into your html file.
        Note: -> The logging feature is removed in the minified version due to file size considerations.
              -> To use plugins like the indicators visualization, simply include them additionally to the 
                 main library:

                 ex.- <script src="js/scrollmagic/uncompressed/plugins/debug.addIndicators.js"></script>

2). Initialization:- (For more..../* http://scrollmagic.io/docs/index.html */)
        Note: ->The basic ScrollMagic design pattern is one controller, which has one or more scenes  
                attached to it.
              ->Each scene is used to define what happens when the container is scrolled to a specific 
                offset.

		$(document).ready(function() {
			// init controller
            var controller = new ScrollMagic.Controller();

            // create a scene
            new ScrollMagic.Scene({
                    duration: 100,    // the scene should last for a scroll distance of 100px
                    offset: 50    // start this scene after scrolling for 50px
                })
                .setPin("#my-sticky-element") // pins the element for the the scene's duration
                .addTo(controller); // assign the scene to the controller
		});
